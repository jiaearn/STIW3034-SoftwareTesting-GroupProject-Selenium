## Introduction
This project is to test the framework of Instagram. Instagram is a well known photo and video sharing social networking service. This social networking service was founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger but was sold to Meta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc. in 2012. Instagram allows its users  to upload media such as photos and videos which later can be edited with filters and organised with taggings. Those uploaded media are then shared publicly or with the user's followers.
